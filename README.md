# AI_mobile_robots
Repository for master thesis


Simulations are run through the Jupyter notebook named run_simulation.ipynb. 
All cells of the notebook should be run. It is possible to adjust the parameters. The first parameter is the map. 
The second is the number of additional human agents. The third (Experiments) takes a list of desired types of robots. 
This is set to all three types. The viz parameter is True or False depending on whether an animation is desired. 
The run_no parameter takes an id for easier identification of the run. The simulation returns summary statistics 
for each run and each type of robot, this is stored in the data frame named data_all.
